name: snapcraft-core22
base: ubuntu@22.04
version: 7.5.4
summary: easily create core22 snaps
description: |
  Snapcraft aims to make upstream developers' lives easier and as such is not
  a single toolset, but instead is a collection of tools that enable the
  natural workflow of an upstream to be extended with a simple release step
  into Snappy.
  This version of Snapcraft is able to build core22 snaps in destructive mode
  only.
